Media aporia no more!

Deporia flags content embedded in webpages likely to be AI-generated or manipulated with a warning icon. AI manipulation reports are submitted by users, and tracked using a backend. Data is stored in Valkey, ensuring fast read/writes and access by image/frame hash.

In the future, we would like to add automated AI content detection using the technology from firms like TwelveLabs.
